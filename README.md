# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
This a Deep Learning first project which predicts Bike Sharing Patterns.  

## Explanation
The Neural network was built from "scratch", using only NumPy to assist.
The goal of this project is to understand what happens behind the neural network
to have full understament of the basic blocks.
